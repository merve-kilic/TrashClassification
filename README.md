# Exploring Data Augmentation for Trash Classification
### Spring 2023 Final Project for ECE 285: Visual Learning

__Abstract:__
This project investigates the impact of data augmentation techniques on the performance of deep learning models trained on the small TrashNet dataset. Two
pre-trained models, ResNet50 and VGG16, were used to classify the trash images.
Data augmentation was performed through traditional image transforms and a more
experimental method using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network
(DCGAN) to generate additional training data. The results indicate that while augmentation techniques hold promise for improving performance on small datasets,
the quality of the generated data significantly influences model performance. The
findings, including that the original dataset-trained model performs best, provide
important insights into the challenges and potential solutions when working with
small datasets in the field of image classification. Overall, it is found that data
augmentation for the TrashNet dataset is not a better approach to potentially be
used to improve trash sorting and recycling efforts
